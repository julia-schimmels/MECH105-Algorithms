# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the algorithms I created for the **MECH105** course at **Colorado State University**, *Mechanical Engineering - Problem Solving*, utilizing different numerical methods. 

They consist of a binary converter, a false position root-finding method, LU factorization, and a numerical method for integrals called the simpson's 1/3 rule. 

Each folder contains a description of the algorithm and how it works, including its inputs, outputs, and any limitations, along with the m-file for the algorithm itself.
