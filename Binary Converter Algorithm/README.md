# Binary Converter Algorithm

## What does it do?
The binary converter algorithm converts a base 10 number (decimal, or "normal" numbers) to an array of its base 2 number (binary). 

### Input
- *base10* - a number in base 10.\

### Output
- *base2* - an array of the input converted to a binary, or base 2, number

### Limitations
- it can only convert from base 10 to base 2
- it can only convert positive base 10 numbers
- the input must be greater than zero
