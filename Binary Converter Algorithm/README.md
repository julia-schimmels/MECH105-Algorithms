# Binary Converter Algorithm

## What does it do?
The binary converter algorithm converts a base 10 number (decimal, or "normal" numbers) to an array of its base 2 number (binary). 

### Input
- *base10* - a number in base 10

### Output
- *base2* - an array of the input converted to a binary, or base 2, number

### Limitations
- it can only convert from base 10 to base 2
- it can only convert positive base 10 numbers
- the input must be greater than zero

### General Information 
Binary is expressed in the base 2 numerical system, meaning it is comprised of 0's and 1's. It is commonly used to store data in computers.
