# LU Factorization 

## What does it do?

The LU factorization algorithm determines the LU factorization of a square matrix with partial pivoting. It is essentially performing linear algebra and provides you with the lower triangular matrix, upper triangular matrix, and pivot matrix.

### Input
The input, (A), is a coefficient matrix

### Output
The outputs, [L], [U], and [P], are the lower triangular matrix, the upper triangular matrix, and the pivot matrix, respectively.

### Limitations
- the algorithm only accepts square matrices
- it does not provide you with the solution to the system but only with the P, L, and U matrices that result from LU factorization.
